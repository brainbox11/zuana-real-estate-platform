It is your responsibility to update and inform us of any changes to the details provided on registration. Although certain parts of our website may be used by anyone who visits without requiring registration, some of the Services require you to register in order to enable us to verify your identity.

                            By registering with the service, you agree that we can send you emails about your account, other zuana.com.ng services and occasional third party offers.

                            When registering, you will be asked to create a password and will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and restricting access to your computer, as you will be accountable for any activities conducted under your password.

                            Materials You Provide

                            Advertising Property on Website

                            Property adverts/listings placed on our website must contain details of only one property in Nigeria per advert/listing. We reserve the right to either split adverts/listings that breach this term into single property adverts/listings or disable such adverts/listings.
                            Charges and Payments

                            Your Responsibilities

                            We are not an estate agency and we provide a service whereby agents may market and you may view property details ('Details') together with other content hosted and developed by us. Agents are responsible for preparing the Details and fielding enquiries directly from you. We do not get involved in any communications between you and agents and we do not participate in any part of the transaction.

                            Details are hosted by us in good faith but are produced directly by agents and have not been verified by us. You are responsible for making your own enquiries and we provide no guarantee and accept no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information contained within the Details.

                                You are responsible for checking, confirming and satisfying yourself as to the accuracy of any Details.
                                You are responsible for instructing a surveyor and obtaining legal advice before committing to any purchase.
                                You are responsible for ensuring that you act in good faith towards any other parties.

                            
                            <p class="title my-2">Availability of Website</p>

                            We strive to ensure that our website and the Services are available to you at all times but cannot guarantee that either the website or the Services will operate continuously, without interruptions or be fault free. On occasion, necessary maintenance or upgrade work requires us to make the website and the Services unavailable without notice, but we aim to keep downtime to a minimum. We accept no liability for any interruption or loss of service. We reserve the absolute right to alter, suspend or discontinue any part of our website or the Services, including your access to it.
                            
                            <p class="title my-2">Third Parties</p>

We have no control over the products, services or websites of these third parties and we do not guarantee or take responsibility for them. Our website may also contain advertising from third parties and we are not responsible for any misleading or inaccurate advertisements which are the sole responsibility of the advertiser. Any links or advertisements on our website should not be taken as an endorsement by us of any kind. Furthermore, our website contains data provided by third parties and we accept no responsibility for any inaccuracies in this material.

You expressly agree that your use of our website and the Services is at your sole risk and we expressly disclaim any and all warranties, either express or implied, including without limitation warranties as to quality, suitability for any purpose, compatibility, reliability, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, access or use. We accept no responsibility and make no guarantee that the Services will be free from faults, errors and/or omissions. It is your sole responsibility to evaluate the quality, suitability, accuracy, completeness and reliability of the Services or any information provided.

                            The value estimates provided on our website are intended for general interest and information purposes only and should not be relied upon for any commercial transaction or similar use. These estimates are based on a) publicly available information which may be inaccurate or incomplete and b) typical properties in certain locations. They will not take account of any factors which are unknown to us and should therefore only be used as a starting guide to help determine what a home might be worth. None of the Services are intended to be a substitute for independent professional advice and users are recommended to seek advice from suitably qualified professionals such as surveyors and solicitors if relevant to their particular circumstances. We shall not be liable for any losses suffered as a result of relying on our value estimates.

                            Property descriptions and other information provided on our website are intended for information and marketing purposes and, whilst displayed in good faith, we will not in any circumstances accept responsibility for their accuracy. It is the responsibility of buyers to satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of any property descriptions and the responsibility of agents to ensure the accuracy of any descriptions provided.
                            
                            <p class="title my-2">Limitation of Liability</p>

Should you not agree with any part of these Terms of Use or have any dispute or claim against us or our suppliers with respect to these Terms of Use or the Services, your sole and exclusive remedy will be to discontinue using the Services.

                            
                            <p class="title my-2">Indemnification</p>

                            You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliated companies, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents or suppliers harmless from any and all claims or demands, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Services, the violation of these Terms of Use by you, or the infringement by you of any intellectual property or other right of any other person or entity.
                            
                            <p class="title my-2">Changes to Terms of Use</p>

                            We reserve the right in our sole discretion to change these Terms of Use at any time without prior notice to you. Any changes will be posted on our website and become effective at the time of posting. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of such changes will constitute acceptance of and agreement to any such changes. We reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue all or part of the Services at any time to you and/or others, with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any other party should we exercise our right to modify, suspend or discontinue all or part of the Services.
                            
                            <p class="title my-2">Applicable Law</p>

                            These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Nigerian law and the parties agree that any disputes will be settled in Nigerian courts. Should any provision of these Terms of Use be determined to be invalid or unenforceable by any court having competent jurisdiction, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a provision that reflects the intent of the original provision, to the extent permitted by applicable law and all other provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.
                            
                            <p class="title my-2">General</p>

We may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you and upon such assignment will be relieved of any further obligation under these Terms of Use. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense your rights, if any, under these Terms of Use. Our delay or failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use with respect to a breach by you or others shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such right to act. We shall not be responsible for any breach of these Terms of Use caused by circumstances beyond our control.

                            These Terms of Use together with the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersede any and all prior agreements and understandings between you and us.
